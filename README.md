# ðŸŽ“ Java Project: Student Records (Serialization)

Hi! This is a simple Java program I made for my **Advanced Java class** at **Miami Dade College**.  
The goal was to save student info into a file (serialize it), then read it back later (deserialize it), and show their average test scores.

## ðŸ“Œ What It Does

- ðŸ‘¤ Creates a list of student names with their test scores
- ðŸ’¾ Saves all the student info to a file you choose
- ðŸ“‚ Loads the info back from the file
- ðŸ“Š Calculates and prints each student's average score

## ðŸ§  Why This Matters

Serialization is basically like turning a bunch of objects (like `Student`) into a form you can store in a file â€” and then bring them back exactly as they were. This project shows how that works using Java's built-in tools.

## ðŸ’» Example Output

Enter the filename to save student records: students.txt
Student records saved successfully.
